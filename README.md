# Cinema-Room-REST-Service
My implementation of Cinema Room REST Service  during Java Backend Developer track at JetBrains Academy.

In this project, I create simple Spring REST service that will help to manage a small movie theatre.
Handle HTTP requests in controllers, create services and respond with JSON objects.
